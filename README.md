# Customer-Segmentation
Welcome to "Clustering (Customer Segmentation) Project".  In this project, customers are required to be segmented according to the purchasing history obtained from the membership cards of a big mall.  After getting to know the data set quickly, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis. There are observation about the distribution of customers according to different variables, also relationships and correlations between variables. Then spesifying the different variables to use for cluster analysis.  Finally, we clustered customers using the K-Means Clustering, Hierarchial Clustiring methods, and label the clusters.
